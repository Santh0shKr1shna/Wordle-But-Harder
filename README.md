# Wordle-But-Harder
I made a wordle game with some changes that makes the game hard and interesting. Do try it out !

### Working
My game takes one string at a time as input like the original wordle game and returns the longest common subsequence of the user's guess and the randomly generated wordle answer. Only the lcs string in your guess is coloured blue after checking.
 
 ### npm run start:backend
 This will start the backend on http://localhost:8000
